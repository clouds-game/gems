"""Single-player search / simulation helper.

This module provides a minimal loop to play a single-player variant of
the gems game until the (only) player's score reaches 15 points or the
player has no non-noop legal actions.

The regular `Engine` enforces 2-4 players; for experimentation we add a
`SinglePlayerEngine` that permits 1 player and reuses all existing
action/payment logic. Visible card refilling still occurs each turn so
the solo player can progress.

Usage (from repository root):

	python -m gems.single_player_search

Or directly:

	python single_player_search.py

Implementation notes:
	- We subclass `Engine` only to relax the num_players check.
	- The loop seeds a deterministic RNG for reproducibility.
	- Uses `GreedyAgent` by default (configurable).
	- Stops when score >= 15 or only NOOP actions remain.
